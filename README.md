# Privacy Dashboard

A React-based dashboard for visualizing privacy events and data access requests. This project uses placeholder data to simulate real-world events, making it ideal for demos and testing privacy-related features.

## Features

- **Dashboard View:** Lists events with ID, User, Type, Timestamp, and Status.
- **Reports View:** Displays privacy reports with severity levels.
- **Data Access Requests:** Shows recent requests for data access.
- **Reusable Data:** Centralized `events.js` file simulates a user/event database.
